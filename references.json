    "abstract": "Engineering genetic networks to be both predictable and robust is a key\nchallenge in synthetic biology. Synthetic circuits must reliably function in\ndynamic, stochastic and heterogeneous environments, and simple circuits can be\nstudied to refine complex gene-regulation models. Although robust behaviours\nsuch as genetic oscillators have been designed and implemented in prokaryotic\nand eukaryotic organisms, a priori genetic engineering of even simple networks\nremains difficult, and many aspects of cell and molecular biology critical to\nengineering robust networks are still inadequately characterized. Particularly,\nperiodic processes such as gene doubling and cell division are rarely\nconsidered in gene regulatory models, which may become more important as\nsynthetic biologists utilize new tools for chromosome integration. We studied a\nchromosome-integrated, negative-feedback circuit based upon the bacteriophage\n{\\lambda} transcriptional repressor Cro and observed strong, feedback-dependent\noscillations in single-cell time traces. This finding was surprising due to a\nlack of cooperativity, long delays or fast protein degradation. We further show\nthat oscillations are synchronized to the cell cycle by gene duplication, with\nphase shifts predictably correlating with estimated gene doubling times.\nFurthermore, we characterized the influence of negative feedback on the\nmagnitude and dynamics of noise in gene expression. Our results show that\ncell-cycle effects must be accounted for in accurate, predictive models for\neven simple gene circuits. Cell-cycle-periodic expression of {\\lambda} Cro also\nsuggests an explanation for cell-size dependence in lysis probability and an\nevolutionary basis for site-specific {\\lambda} integration.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a simple and highly efficient method to disrupt chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli in which PCR primers provide the homology to the targeted gene(s). In this procedure, recombination requires the phage lambda Red recombinase, which is synthesized under the control of an inducible promoter on an easily curable, low copy number plasmid. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we generated PCR products by using primers with 36- to 50-nt extensions that are homologous to regions adjacent to the gene to be inactivated and template plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes that are flanked by FRT (FLP recognition target) sites. By using the respective PCR products, we made 13 different disruptions of chromosomal genes. Mutants of the arcB, cyaA, lacZYA, ompR-envZ, phnR, pstB, pstCA, pstS, pstSCAB-phoU, recA, and torSTRCAD genes or operons were isolated as antibiotic-resistant colonies after the introduction into bacteria carrying a Red expression plasmid of synthetic (PCR-generated) DNA. The resistance genes were then eliminated by using a helper plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase which is also easily curable. This procedure should be widely useful, especially in genome analysis of E. coli and other bacteria because the procedure can be done in wild-type cells.",

    "abstract": "The genetic and biochemical networks which underlie such things as homeostasis in metabolism and the developmental programs of living cells, must withstand considerable variations and random perturbations of biochemical parameters. These occur as transient changes in, for example, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation. The intensity and duration of these perturbations differ between cells in a population. The unique state of cells, and thus the diversity in a population, is owing to the different environmental stimuli the individual cells experience and the inherent stochastic nature of biochemical processes (for example, refs 5 and 6). It has been proposed, but not demonstrated, that autoregulatory, negative feedback loops in gene circuits provide stability, thereby limiting the range over which the concentrations of network components fluctuate. Here we have designed and constructed simple gene circuits consisting of a regulator and transcriptional repressor modules in Escherichia coli and we show the gain of stability produced by negative feedback.",

    "abstract": "We have examined anhydrotetracycline (atc) binding to Tet repressor (TetR) in dependence of the Mg(2+) concentration. Of all tc compounds tested so far, atc has the highest affinity for TetR, with a K(A) of 9.8 x 10(11) M(-1) in the presence of Mg(2+) and 6.5 x 10(7) M(-1) without Mg(2+). Thus, it binds TetR with 500-fold higher affinity than tc under both conditions. The Mg(2+)-free binding of atc to TetR leads to induction in vitro, demonstrating that the metal is not necessary to trigger the associated conformational change. To obtain more detailed information about Mg(2+)-free induction, we constructed and prepared to homogeneity four single-alanine substitution mutants of TetR. Three of them affect residues involved in contacting Mg(2+) (TetR H100A, E147A, and T103A), and one altered residue contacts tc TetR N82A. TetR H100A and E147A are induced by atc, with and without Mg(2+), showing 110-fold and 1000-fold decreased Mg(2+)-dependent and unchanged Mg(2+)-independent atc binding, respectively. Thus, the contacts of these residues to Mg(2+) are not necessary for induction. TetR N82A is not inducible under any of the conditions employed and shows an about 4000-fold decreased atc binding constant. The Mg(2+)-dependent affinity of TetR T103A for atc is only 400-fold reduced, but no induction with atc was observed. Thus, Thr103 must be essential for the conformational change associated with induction in the absence of Mg(2+).",

    "abstract": "We report for the first time the in vitro characterization of a reverse tetracycline repressor (revTetR). The dimeric wild-type repressor (TetR) binds to tet operator tetO in the absence of the inducer anhydrotetracycline (atc) to confer tight repression. We have isolated the revTetR G96E L205S mutant, which, contrary to TetR, binds tetO only in the presence of atc. This reverse acting mutant was overproduced and purified. Effector and DNA binding properties were analyzed by EMSA and quantified by fluorescence titration and surface plasmon resonance. The association constant K(A) of revTetR for binding of [atcMg](+) is approximately 10(8) M(-1), four orders of magnitude lower than that of TetR. The affinity of TetR for tetO is 5.6 +/- 2 x 10(9) M(-1) and that for revTetR in the presence of atc is 1 +/- 0.2 x 10(8) M(-1). Both induced forms, the atc-bound TetR and the free revTetR, have the same low affinity of 4 +/- 1 x 10(5) M(-1) for DNA. Therefore, atc does not act as a dimerization agent for revTetR. We discuss the structural differences between TetR and revTetR potentially underlying this reversal of activity.",

    "abstract": "Protein levels have been shown to vary substantially between individual cells in clonal populations. In prokaryotes, the contribution to such fluctuations from the inherent randomness of gene expression has largely been attributed to having just a few transcripts of the corresponding mRNAs. By contrast, eukaryotic studies tend to emphasize chromatin remodeling and burst-like transcription. Here, we study single-cell transcription in Escherichia coli by measuring mRNA levels in individual living cells. The results directly demonstrate transcriptional bursting, similar to that indirectly inferred for eukaryotes. We also measure mRNA partitioning at cell division and correlate mRNA and protein levels in single cells. Partitioning is approximately binomial, and mRNA-protein correlations are weaker earlier in the cell cycle, where cell division has recently randomized the relative concentrations. Our methods further extend protein-based approaches by counting the integer-valued number of transcript with single-molecule resolution. This greatly facilitates kinetic interpretations in terms of the integer-valued random processes that produce the fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "In vivo induction of the Escherichia coli lactose operon as a function of inducer concentration generates a sigmoidal curve, indicating a non-linear response. Suggested explanations for this dependence include a 2:1 inducer-repressor stoichiometry of induction, which is the currently accepted view. It is, however, known for decades that, in vitro, operator binding as a function of inducer concentration is not sigmoidal. This discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro data has so far not been resolved. We demonstrate that the in vivo non-linearity of induction is due to cooperative repression of the wild-type lac operon through DNA loop formation. In the absence of DNA loops, in vivo induction curves are hyperbolic. In the light of this result, we re-address the question of functional molecular inducer-repressor stoichiometry in induction of the lac operon.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins are widely used for dual color imaging and protein-protein interaction studies based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Use of these fluorescent proteins can be limited by their thermosensitivity, dim fluorescence, and tendency for aggregation. Here we report the results of a site-directed mutagenesis approach to improve these fluorescent proteins. We created monomeric optimized variants of ECFP and EYFP, which fold faster and more efficiently at 37 degrees C and have superior solubility and brightness. Bacteria expressing SCFP3A were 9-fold brighter than those expressing ECFP and 1.2-fold brighter than bacteria expressing Cerulean. SCFP3A has an increased quantum yield (0.56) and fluorescence lifetime. Bacteria expressing SYFP2 were 12 times brighter than those expressing EYFP(Q69K) and almost 2-fold brighter than bacteria expressing Venus. In HeLa cells, the improvements were less pronounced; nonetheless, cells expressing SCFP3A and SYFP2 were both 1.5-fold brighter than cells expressing ECFP and EYFP(Q69K), respectively. The enhancements of SCFP3A and SYFP2 are most probably due to an increased intrinsic brightness (1.7-fold and 1.3-fold for purified recombinant proteins, compared to ECFP & EYFP(Q69K), respectively) and due to enhanced protein folding and maturation. The latter enhancements most significantly contribute to the increased fluorescent yield in bacteria whereas they appear less significant for mammalian cell systems. SCFP3A and SYFP2 make a superior donor-acceptor pair for fluorescence resonance energy transfer, because of the high quantum yield and increased lifetime of SCFP3A and the high extinction coefficient of SYFP2. Furthermore, SCFP1, a CFP variant with a short fluorescence lifetime but identical spectra compared to ECFP and SCFP3A, was characterized. Using the large lifetime difference between SCFP1 and SCFP3A enabled us to perform for the first time dual-lifetime imaging of spectrally identical fluorescent species in living cells.",

    "abstract": "Negative feedback loops have been invoked as a way to control and decrease transcriptional noise. Here, we have built three circuits to test the effect of negative feedback loops on transcriptional noise of an autoregulated gene encoding a transcription factor (TF) and a downstream gene (DG), regulated by this TF. Experimental analysis shows that self-repression decreases noise compared to expression from a non-regulated promoter. Interestingly enough, we find that noise minimization by negative feedback loop is optimal within a range of repression strength. Repression values outside this range result in noise increase producing a U-shaped behaviour. This behaviour is the result of external noise probably arising from plasmid fluctuations as shown by simulation of the network. Regarding the target gene of a self-repressed TF (sTF), we find a strong decrease of noise when repression by the sTF is strong and a higher degree of noise anti-correlation between sTF and its target. Simulations of the circuits indicate that the main source of noise in these circuits could come from plasmid variation and therefore that negative feedback loops play an important role in suppressing both external and internal noise. An important observation is that DG expression without negative feedback exhibits bimodality at intermediate TF repression values. This bimodal behaviour seems to be the result of external noise as it can only be found in those simulations that include plasmid variation.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells spatially organize mRNA processes such as translation and mRNA decay. Much less is clear in bacterial cells where the spatial distribution of mature mRNA remains ambiguous. Using a sensitive method based on quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization, we show here that in Caulobacter crescentus and Escherichia coli, chromosomally expressed mRNAs largely display limited dispersion from their site of transcription during their lifetime. We estimate apparent diffusion coefficients at least two orders of magnitude lower than expected for freely diffusing mRNA, and provide evidence in C. crescentus that this mRNA localization restricts ribosomal mobility. Furthermore, C. crescentus RNase E appears associated with the DNA independently of its mRNA substrates. Collectively, our findings show that bacteria can spatially organize translation and, potentially, mRNA decay by using the chromosome layout as a template. This chromosome-centric organization has important implications for cellular physiology and for our understanding of gene expression in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Cellular messenger RNA levels are achieved by the combinatorial complexity of factors controlling transcription, yet the small number of molecules involved in these pathways fluctuates stochastically. It has not yet been experimentally possible to observe the activity of single polymerases on an endogenous gene to elucidate how these events occur in vivo. Here, we describe a method of fluctuation analysis of fluorescently labeled RNA to measure dynamics of nascent RNA--including initiation, elongation, and termination--at an active yeast locus. We find no transcriptional memory between initiation events, and elongation speed can vary by threefold throughout the cell cycle. By measuring the abundance and intranuclear mobility of an upstream transcription factor, we observe that the gene firing rate is directly determined by trans-activating factor search times.",

    "abstract": "We tested the effect of systematic destruction of all three lac operators of the chromosomal lac operon of Escherichia coli on repression by Lac repressor. Absence of just one 'pseudo-operator' O2 or O3 decreases repression by wild-type tetrameric Lac repressor approximately 2- to 3-fold; absence of both 'pseudo-operators' decreases repression greater than 50-fold. O1 alone represses under these conditions only approximately 20-fold. Dimeric active Lac repressor (iadi) represses the wild-type lac operon to about the same low extent. This indicates that cooperative interaction between lac operators is due to DNA loop formation mediated by tetrameric Lac repressor. Under conditions where loop formation is impossible, occupation of O3 but not of O2 may lead to weak repression. This suggests that under these conditions CAP activation may be inhibited and that stopping transcription at O2 does not significantly contribute to repression.",

Optimizing such systems often requires screening combinations of origins of replication, expression systems, and antibiotic markers. This procedure is hampered by a lack of quantitative data on how these components behave when more than one origin of replication or expression system are used simultaneously. Additionally, this process can be time consuming as it often requires the creation of new vectors or cloning into existing but disparate vectors.",

    "abstract": "Imaging mRNA with single-molecule sensitivity in live cells has become an indispensable tool for quantitatively studying RNA biology. The MS2 system has been extensively used due to its unique simplicity and sensitivity. However, the levels of the coat protein needed for consistent labeling of mRNAs limits the sensitivity and quantitation of this technology. Here, we applied fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy to quantitatively characterize and enhance the MS2 system. Surprisingly, we found that a high fluorescence background resulted from inefficient dimerization of fluorescent protein (FP)-labeled MS2 coat protein (MCP). To mitigate this problem, we used a single-chain tandem dimer of MCP (tdMCP) that significantly increased the uniformity and sensitivity of mRNA labeling. Furthermore, we characterized the PP7 coat protein and the binding to its respective RNA stem loop. We conclude that the PP7 system performs better for RNA labeling. Finally, we used these improvements to study endogenous Î²-actin mRNA, which has 24xMS2 binding sites inserted into the 3' untranslated region. The tdMCP-FP allowed uniform RNA labeling and provided quantitative measurements of endogenous mRNA concentration and diffusion. This work provides a foundation for quantitative spectroscopy and imaging of single mRNAs directly in live cells.",

    "abstract": "The ribosome's interactions with mRNA govern its translation rate and the effects of post-transcriptional regulation. Long, structured 5' untranslated regions (5' UTRs) are commonly found in bacterial mRNAs, though the physical mechanisms that determine how the ribosome binds these upstream regions remain poorly defined. Here, we systematically investigate the ribosome's interactions with structured standby sites, upstream of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and show that these interactions can modulate translation initiation rates by over 100-fold. We find that an mRNA's translation initiation rate is controlled by the amount of single-stranded surface area, the partial unfolding of RNA structures to minimize the ribosome's binding free energy penalty, the absence of cooperative binding and the potential for ribosomal sliding. We develop a biophysical model employing thermodynamic first principles and a four-parameter free energy model to accurately predict the ribosome's translation initiation rates for 136 synthetic 5' UTRs with large structures, diverse shapes and multiple standby site modules. The model predicts and experiments confirm that the ribosome can readily bind distant standby site modules that support high translation rates, providing a physical mechanism for observed context effects and long-range post-transcriptional regulation.

    "abstract": "Flow cytometry is widely used to measure gene expression and other molecular biological processes with single cell resolution via fluorescent probes. Flow cytometers output data in arbitrary units (a.u.) that vary with the probe, instrument, and settings. Arbitrary units can be converted to the calibrated unit molecules of equivalent fluorophore (MEF) using commercially available calibration particles. However, there is no convenient, nonproprietary tool available to perform this calibration. Consequently, most researchers report data in a.u., limiting interpretation. Here, we report a software tool named FlowCal to overcome current limitations. FlowCal can be run using an intuitive Microsoft Excel interface, or customizable Python scripts. The software accepts Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files as inputs and is compatible with different calibration particles, fluorescent probes, and cell types. Additionally, FlowCal automatically gates data, calculates common statistics, and produces publication quality plots. We validate FlowCal by calibrating a.u. measurements of E.Â coli expressing superfolder GFP (sfGFP) collected at 10 different detector sensitivity (gain) settings to a single MEF value. Additionally, we reduce day-to-day variability in replicate E.Â coli sfGFP expression measurements due to instrument drift by 33%, and calibrate S.Â cerevisiae Venus expression data to MEF units. Finally, we demonstrate a simple method for using FlowCal to calibrate fluorescence units across different cytometers. FlowCal should ease the quantitative analysis of flow cytometry data within and across laboratories and facilitate the adoption of standard fluorescence units in synthetic biology and beyond.",

Detailed knowledge of cell-to-cell variations with respect to cellular growth and product formation is limited, even though phenotypic heterogeneity may distinctly hamper overall production yields, especially for toxic or difficult-to-express proteins. Unraveling phenotypic heterogeneity is thus a key aspect in understanding and optimizing recombinant protein production in biotechnology and synthetic biology. Here, microfluidic single-cell analysis serves as the method of choice to investigate and unmask population heterogeneities in a dynamic and spatiotemporal fashion. In this study, we report on comparative microfluidic single-cell analyses of commonly used E. coli expression systems to uncover system-inherent specifications in the synthetic M9CA growth medium. To this end, the PT7lac/LacI, the PBAD/AraC and the Pm/XylS system were systematically analyzed in order to gain detailed insights into variations of growth behavior and expression phenotypes and thus to uncover individual strengths and deficiencies at the single-cell level. Specifically, we evaluated the impact of different system-specific inducers, inducer concentrations as well as genetic modifications that affect inducer-uptake and regulation of target gene expression on responsiveness and phenotypic heterogeneity. Interestingly, the most frequently applied expression system based on E. coli strain BL21(DE3) clearly fell behind with respect to expression homogeneity and robustness of growth. Moreover, both the choice of inducer and the presence of inducer uptake systems proved crucial for phenotypic heterogeneity. Conclusively, microfluidic evaluation of different inducible E. coli expression systems and setups identified the modified lacY-deficient PT7lac/LacI as well as the Pm/XylS system with conventional m-toluic acid induction as key players for precise and robust triggering of bacterial gene expression in E. coli in a homogeneous fashion.

    "abstract": "The performance of FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) biosensors depends on brightness and photostability, which are dependent on the characteristics of the fluorescent proteins that are employed. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) is often used as an acceptor but YFP is prone to photobleaching and pH changes. In this study, we evaluated the properties of a diverse set of acceptor fluorescent proteins in combination with the optimized CFP variant mTurquoise2 as the donor. To determine the theoretical performance of acceptors, the FÃ¶rster radius was determined. The practical performance was determined by measuring FRET efficiency and photostability of tandem fusion proteins in mammalian cells. Our results show that mNeonGreen is the most efficient acceptor for mTurquoise2 and that the photostability is better than SYFP2. The non-fluorescent YFP variant sREACh is an efficient acceptor, which is useful in lifetime-based FRET experiments. Among the orange and red fluorescent proteins, mCherry and mScarlet-I are the best performing acceptors. Several new pairs were applied in a multimolecular FRET based sensor for detecting activation of a heterotrimeric G-protein by G-protein coupled receptors. Overall, the sensor with mNeonGreen as acceptor and mTurquoise2 as donor showed the highest dynamic range in ratiometric FRET imaging experiments with the G-protein sensor.",

    "abstract": "Experiments in synthetic biology and microbiology can benefit from protein expression systems with low cell-to-cell variability (noise) and expression levels precisely tunable across a useful dynamic range. Despite advances in understanding the molecular biology of microbial gene regulation, many experiments employ protein-expression systems exhibiting high noise and nearly all-or-none responses to induction. I present an expression system that incorporates elements known to reduce gene expression noise: negative autoregulation and bicistronic transcription. I show by stochastic simulation that while negative autoregulation can produce a more gradual response to induction, bicistronic expression of a repressor and gene of interest can be necessary to reduce noise below the extrinsic limit. I synthesized a plasmid-based system incorporating these principles and studied its properties in Escherichia coli cells, using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy to characterize induction dose-response, induction/repression kinetics and gene expression noise. By varying ribosome binding site strengths, expression levels from 55-10,740 molecules/cell were achieved with noise below the extrinsic limit. Individual strains are inducible across a dynamic range greater than 20-fold. Experimental comparison of different regulatory networks confirmed that bicistronic autoregulation reduces noise, and revealed unexpectedly high noise for a conventional expression system with a constitutively expressed transcriptional repressor. I suggest a hybrid, low-noise expression system to increase the dynamic range.",

    "abstract": "The MS2-MCP system enables researchers to image multiple steps of the mRNA life cycle with high temporal and spatial resolution. However, for short-lived mRNAs, the tight binding of the MS2 coat protein (MCP) to the MS2 binding sites (MBS) protects the RNA from being efficiently degraded, and this confounds the study of mRNA regulation. Here, we describe a reporter system (MBSV6) with reduced affinity for the MCP, which allows mRNA degradation while preserving single-molecule detection determined by single-molecule FISH (smFISH) or live imaging. Constitutive mRNAs (MDN1 and DOA1) and highly-regulated mRNAs (GAL1 and ASH1) endogenously tagged with MBSV6 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae degrade normally. As a result, short-lived mRNAs were imaged throughout their complete life cycle. The MBSV6 reporter revealed that, in contrast to previous findings, coordinated recruitment of mRNAs at specialized structures such as P-bodies during stress did not occur, and mRNA degradation was heterogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "Constituents of multiprotein complexes are required at well-defined levels relative to each other. However, it remains unknown whether eukaryotic cells typically produce precise amounts of subunits, or instead rely on degradation to mitigate imprecise production. Here, we quantified the production rates of multiprotein complexes in unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes using ribosome profiling. By resolving read-mapping ambiguities, which occur for a large fraction of ribosome footprints and distort quantitation accuracy in eukaryotes, we found that obligate components of multiprotein complexes are produced in proportion to their stoichiometry, indicating that their abundances are already precisely tuned at the synthesis level. By systematically interrogating the impact of gene dosage variations in budding yeast, we found a general lack of negative feedback regulation protecting the normally precise rates of subunit synthesis. These results reveal a core principle of proteome homeostasis and highlight the evolution toward quantitative control at every step in the central dogma.",

We introduced random amino acid (aa) substitutions in the twenty aa flanking the chromophore Ser-Tyr-Gly sequence at aa 65-67. We then used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to select variants of GFP that fluoresce between 20-and 35-fold more intensely than wild type (wt), when excited at 488 nm. Sequence analysis reveals three classes of aa substitutions in GFP. All three classes of mutant proteins have highly shifted excitation maxima. In addition, when produced in E. coli, the folding of the mutant proteins is more efficient than folding of wt GFP. These two properties contribute to a greatly increased (100-fold) fluorescence intensity, making the mutants useful for a number of applications.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic termination of T7 RNA polymerase transcription occurs at different signals in vitro. One type of signal is similar to that mediating factor-independent termination of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, whereas the other type does not involve RNA hairpin formation. By examining the termination behaviour of T7 RNA polymerase at the E.coli rrnB operon t1 terminator, at the T7-t(phi) terminator, at the human preproparathyroid hormone gene terminator on both single- and double-stranded templates, and in the presence of GTP or ITP during transcription, we show that the termination event can be mediated by either RNA or DNA structural features. Moreover, by using co-transcriptional probing with potassium permanganate, we present evidence for the presence of transcription-induced hyperreactive thymidines on the non-template strand in the DNA-mediated event, and a putative sequence motif is identified. We conclude that intrinsic termination of T7 RNA polymerase transcription in vitro can be mediated either by a hairpin in the nascent RNA or by a sequence motif including hyperreactive thymidines in the non-template DNA strand.",

    "abstract": "Based on parameters governing promoter activity and using regulatory elements of the lac, ara and tet operon transcription control sequences were composed which permit the regulation in Escherichia coli of several gene activities independently and quantitatively. The novel promoter PLtetO-1 allows the regulation of gene expression over an up to 5000-fold range with anhydrotetracycline (aTc) whereas with IPTG and arabinose the activity of Plac/ara-1 may be controlled 1800-fold. Escherichia coli host strains which produce defined amounts of the regulatory proteins, Lac and Tet repressor as well as AraC from chromosomally located expression units provide highly reproducible in vivo conditions. Controlling the expression of the genes encoding luciferase, the low abundance E.coli protein DnaJ and restriction endonuclease Cfr9I not only demonstrates that high levels of expression can be achieved but also suggests that under conditions of optimal repression only around one mRNA every 3rd generation is produced. This potential of quantitative control will open up new approaches in the study of gene function in vivo, in particular with low abundance regulatory gene products. The system will also provide new opportunities for the controlled expression of heterologous genes.",
