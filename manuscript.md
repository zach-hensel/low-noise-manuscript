## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Some microbiology experiments and biotechnology applications can be improved if it is possible to tune the expression of two different genes at the same time with cell-to-cell variation at or below the level of genes constitutively expressed from the chromosome (the “extrinsic noise limit”). This was recently achieved for a single gene by exploiting negative autoregulation by the tetracycline repressor (TetR), and bicistronic gene expression to reduce gene expression noise. We report new plasmids that use the same principles to achieve simultaneous, low-noise expression for two genes. The TetR system was moved to a compatible plasmid backbone, and a system based on the lactose repressor (LacI) was found to also exhibit gene expression noise below the extrinsic noise limit. We characterized gene expression mean and noise across the range of induction levels for these strains, applied the LacI system to tune expression for single-molecule mRNA detection in two different growth conditions, and showed that two plasmids can be co-transformed to independently tune expression of two different genes.

## Introduction {.page_break_before}

We recently reported the development of a plasmid-based gene-expression system in which a gene of interest is expressed bicistronically with the tetracycline repressor (TetR) [@RB57dahw]. Using this gene expression system, cell-to-cell is below the “extrinsic noise limit” observed for genes expressed from the chromosome [@oD6kpSs3]. When TetR and GFP are expressed bicistronically, GFP induction and gene expression noise is similar to that observed for a TetR-GFP fusion protein with autoregulation [@x1Hd2npA]. Compared to induction of gene expression under the control of a constitutively expressed transcriptional repressor, the inducer dose-response is relatively linearized, and gene expression noise is much lower at intermediate induction levels.

Why this would it be useful to do this for two different genes at the same time?
Example for stoichiometric production of a protein complex
Expressing genes at their native levels … e.g. for generating chromosome deletions

## Methods 

### Strain construction

All plasmids were constructed using isothermal assembly [@dc6GAnhL] of fragments generated by PCR or double stranded DNA synthesis (IDT) and transformed Top10 E. coli cells (IBA #5-1600-020). Transformants were screened by colony PCR and verified by sequencing. Sequence maps are included as supplementary files and plasmids will be made available at AddGene after deposit and screening [@q8xLcfYV]. Purified plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain MG1655 by growing 2 mL of culture in SOB media at 37 C to OD600=0.4, washing twice with 1 mL ice-cold water, resuspending in 40 µL water, electroporation of 1–10 ng plasmid with the EC1 setting of a Micropulser (BioRad), and recovering for 1 hour at 37 C in SOC media.

To generate pJS101 with a compatible backbone, plasmid pZH509 [@RB57dahw] was used as a template to amplify the bicistronic regulatory construct including the P~LtetO-1~ promoter [@NCWOk1rp], GFPmut2 [@13TJF2gcl], tn10 TetR [@Q1a7tU8] and rrnB T1 transcription terminator [@xjKSoV9v]. This was assembled by isothermal assembly with the backbone from pGB2 [@5CRbRLYC] with the pSC101 origin of replication and spectinomycin resistance to generate plasmid pJS101. Plasmids with the pSC101 and p15a origins of replication have been co-transformed in previous synthetic biology experiments [@fyyCRa8e].

Plasmids pJS102 and pJS103 were generated by 3-fragment isothermal assembly. Plasmid pZH509 was used as a template both for the vector backbone and for GFPmut2, with non-homologous extensions added to PCR primers to generate the P~LlacO~ and P~LlacOsym~ promoters. Promoter P~LlacOsym~ lacks the central G–C base pair in P~LlacO~ LacI binding sites, which are symmetrical [@swicCLW1] except that the second *lacOsym* sequence has one base changed to maintain the P~LlacO~ promoter –10 sequence. LacI was amplified from *E. coli* MG1655 by colony PCR. Plasmid pJS23103 was made by isothermal assembly of an inverse PCR product of pZH509, with non-homologous primer extensions adding the weak, constitutive BBa_J23103 promoter between GFPmut2 and TetR [@ZZUG1lTS].

Plasmids were co-transformed into MG1655 by electroporation following the above protocol, except with 1 µL each undiluted plasmid (~20–40 ng) and selecting on plates with both spectinomycin and carbenicillin.

### Cell Growth

Cells were grown in overnight cultures at 32 C in M9 minimal media supplemented with 1% SOB media, 50 µg/mL carbenicillin or 50 µg/mL spectinomycin. The next day, cells were diluted 1:100 or more (if multiple experiments were to be done sequentially over several hours) in the same media supplemented with anhydrotetracycline. In this growth condition, doubling time was approximately 30 minutes for MG1655 strains harboring these plasmids.

## Discussion

Possible to improve pJS23103 with somewhat stronger promoter?

Possible to extend to 3 genes? Possible using additional repressor, pMB1 origin of replication, and different antibiotic selection.
