## Introduction {.page_break_before}

We recently reported the development of a plasmid-based gene-expression system in which a gene of interest is expressed bicistronically with the tetracycline repressor (TetR) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0187259]. Using this gene expression system, cell-to-cell is below the “extrinsic noise limit” observed for genes expressed from the chromosome [@doi:10.1126/science.1188308]. When TetR and GFP are expressed bicistronically, GFP induction and gene expression noise is similar to that observed for a TetR-GFP fusion protein with autoregulation [@doi:10.1038/msb4100081]. Compared to induction of gene expression under the control of a constitutively expressed transcriptional repressor, the inducer dose-response is relatively linearized, and gene expression noise is much lower at intermediate induction levels.
