## Introduction {.page_break_before}

We recently reported the development of a plasmid-based gene-expression system in which a gene of interest is expressed bicistronically with the tetracycline repressor (TetR) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0187259]. Using this gene expression system, cell-to-cell is below the “extrinsic noise limit” observed for genes expressed from the chromosome [@doi:10.1126/science.1188308]. When TetR and GFP are expressed bicistronically, GFP induction and gene expression noise is similar to that observed for a TetR-GFP fusion protein with autoregulation [@doi:10.1038/msb4100081]. Compared to induction of gene expression under the control of a constitutively expressed transcriptional repressor, the inducer dose-response is relatively linearized, and gene expression noise is much lower at intermediate induction levels.

Why this would it be useful to do this for two different genes at the same time?
Example for stoichiometric production of a protein complex
Expressing genes at their native levels … e.g. for generating chromosome deletions
