## Introduction {.page_break_before}

We recently reported the development of a plasmid-based gene-expression system in which a gene of interest is expressed bicistronically with the tetracycline repressor (TetR) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0187259]. Using this gene expression system, cell-to-cell variation is below the “extrinsic noise limit” (coefficient of variation squared of protein concentration, $CV^2 \approx 0.1$) observed for genes expressed from the chromosome [@doi:10.1126/science.1188308]. When TetR and GFP are expressed bicistronically, GFP induction and gene expression noise is similar to that observed for a TetR-GFP fusion protein with autoregulation [@doi:10.1038/msb4100081]. Compared to induction of gene expression under the control of a constitutively expressed transcriptional repressor, the inducer dose-response is relatively linearized, and gene expression noise is much lower at intermediate induction levels [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0187259].

Our recent experiments in mRNA detection and other single-molecule experiments in living *E. coli* cells sometimes require the tunable expression of two different genes, both with low noise levels. For example, adopting a recently reported mRNA detection systems based on local enrichment of fluorescent RNA-binding proteins [@pmid:29131164] for use in *E. coli* requires lower noise in protein production relative to the same system in *S. cerevisiae*, because of a smaller cell volume and the inability to sequester unbound protein in the nucleus. At the same time, tunable expression with low noise in the level of the target RNA is desired to make it possible to characterize the accuracy of RNA detection over a range of RNA levels. We hoped that expressing both the target RNA and RNA-binding fluorescent protein on two plasmids that could be tuned independently would simplify and accelerate development of new RNA-detection systems in *E. coli*. Achieving this was a three-step process: first, characterizing the TetR-based system on a compatible plasmid backbone; second, establishing an orthogonal, low-noise expression system based on the *lac* repressor (LacI); and third, showing that the two systems can be tuned independently.
