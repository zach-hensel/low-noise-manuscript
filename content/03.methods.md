## Methods 

### Strain construction

All plasmids were constructed using isothermal assembly [@doi:10.1038/nmeth.1318] of fragments generated by PCR or double stranded DNA synthesis (IDT, Coralville) and transformed Top10 E. coli cells (5-1600-020, IBA Life Sciences, Göttingen). Transformants were screened by colony PCR and verified by sequencing. Purified plasmids were transformed into *E. coli* strain MG1655 by growing 3 mL of culture in SOB media at 30 °C to OD600=0.4, washing twice with 1 mL ice-cold water, resuspending in 40 µL water, electroporating 1-–10 ng plasmid with the EC1 setting of a Micropulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules), and recovering for 1 hour at 37 °C in SOC media before plating on selective LB-agar.

To generate pJS101 with a compatible backbone, plasmid pZH509 [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0187259] was used as a template to amplify the bicistronic regulatory construct including the P~LtetO-1~ promoter [@pmid:9092630], GFPmut2 [@pmid:8707053], tn10 TetR [@doi:10.1093/nar/12.12.4849] and rrnB T1 transcription terminator [@pmid:8887568]. This was assembled by isothermal assembly with the backbone from pGB2 [@pmid:6098521] with the pSC101 origin of replication and spectinomycin resistance to generate plasmid pJS101. Plasmid pJS102 was generated by 3-fragment isothermal assembly. Plasmid pZH509 was used as a template both for the vector backbone and for GFPmut2, with non-homologous extensions added to PCR primers to generate the P~LlacO-1~ promoter. LacI was amplified from *E. coli* MG1655 by colony PCR.

Plasmids were co-transformed into MG1655 by electroporation following the above protocol, except with 1 µL each undiluted plasmid (~20–-40 ng) and selecting on LB-agar plates with both spectinomycin and carbenicillin. Sequence maps are included in supplementary file and plasmids useful for constructing additionally 2-gene expression systems (pJS101 and pJS102, **Table {@tbl:plasmidList}**) are available at AddGene (deposit numbers 118280 and 118281) and have been verified by NGS [@url:https://www.addgene.org/Zach_Hensel/].

The test strain for mRNA imaging, ZHX99, was constructed similar to ZHX222 in recent work [@arxiv:1506.08596]. Similarly, in ZHX99 a construct in which a fusion protein of mVenus and Cro is expressed from the bacteriophage λ promoter *P~R~* was integrated into the chromosome to replace the *lac* operon in MG1655 [@pmid:10829079]. ZHX99 differs from ZHX222 in three ways. First, the *P~R~* promoter was weakened by site-directed mutagenesis to produce a strain with lower mRNA levels. Second, a very strong ribosome binding site was added (RBS #136 [@pmid:24234441]). Lastly, 24 tandem repeats of the recognition sequence for the PP7 coat protein were inserted between the open reading frame and transcription terminator (amplified by PCR from pDZ251 [@pmid:21512033]). The pZH713 plasmid for mRNA detection was constructed by replacing GFPmut2 in pJS102 with a fusion protein of SYFP2 (amplified from a plasmid [@pmid:16716067]) and the PP7 coat protein (PP7cp) (generated by codon optimization and DNA synthesis based on previously reported sequences [@pmid:22735544]). Additionally, in pZH713 the PP7cp-SYFP2 fusion protein is translated from the weak ribosome binding site from pZH511 [@pmid:29084263].

### Characterization of GFP expression by flow cytometry

All flow cytometry experiment were repeated 3 times on different days and used plasmids transformed by electroporation into *E. coli* MG1655. Cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C from LB-agar plates supplemented with carbenicillin or spectinomycin (both at 50 $\frac{\mu g}{mL}$) in 1 mL EZ Rich Defined Medium (M2105, Teknova, Hollister) supplemented with the same antibiotics.

### Microscopy



### SM-FISH

Cells were grown in overnight cultures at 32 C in M9 minimal media supplemented with 1% SOB media, 50 µg/mL carbenicillin or 50 µg/mL spectinomycin. The next day, cells were diluted 1:100 or more (if multiple experiments were to be done sequentially over several hours) in the same media supplemented with anhydrotetracycline. In this growth condition, doubling time was approximately 30 minutes for MG1655 strains harboring these plasmids.
