## Methods 

### Strain construction

All plasmids were constructed using isothermal assembly [@doi:10.1038/nmeth.1318] of fragments generated by PCR or double stranded DNA synthesis (IDT) and transformed Top10 E. coli cells (IBA #5-1600-020). Transformants were screened by colony PCR and verified by sequencing. Sequence maps are included as supplementary files and plasmids will be made available at AddGene after deposit and screening [@url:https://www.addgene.org/Zach_Hensel/]. Purified plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain MG1655 by growing 2 mL of culture in SOB media at 37 C to OD600=0.4, washing twice with 1 mL ice-cold water, resuspending in 40 µL water, electroporation of 1–10 ng plasmid with the EC1 setting of a Micropulser (BioRad), and recovering for 1 hour at 37 C in SOC media.

Plasmid pZH509 [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0187259] was used as a template to amplify the bicistronic regulatory construct including the P~LtetO-1~ promoter, GFPmut2 [@pmid:8707053], tn10 TetR [@doi:10.1093/nar/12.12.4849] and rrnB T1 transcription terminator [@pmid:8887568]. This was assembled by isothermal assembly with the backbone from pGB2 [@pmid:6098521] with the pSC101 origin of replication and spectinomycin resistance to generate plasmid pJS101. Plasmids with the pSC101 and p15a origins of replication have been co-transformed in previous synthetic biology experiments [@doi:10.1186/1754-1611-5-12].

### Cell Growth

Cells were grown in overnight cultures at 32 C in M9 minimal media supplemented with 1% SOB media, 50 µg/mL carbenicillin or 50 µg/mL spectinomycin. The next day, cells were diluted 1:100 or more (if multiple experiments were to be done sequentially over several hours) in the same media supplemented with anhydrotetracycline. In this growth condition, doubling time was approximately 30 minutes for MG1655 strains harboring these plasmids.
