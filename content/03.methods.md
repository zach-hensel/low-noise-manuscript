## Methods 

### Strain construction

All plasmids were constructed using isothermal assembly [@doi:10.1038/nmeth.1318] of fragments generated by PCR or double stranded DNA synthesis (IDT) and transformed Top10 E. coli cells (IBA #5-1600-020). Transformants were screened by colony PCR and verified by sequencing. Sequence maps are included as supplementary files and plasmids will be made available at AddGene after deposit and screening [@url:https://www.addgene.org/Zach_Hensel/]. Purified plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain MG1655 by growing 2 mL of culture in SOB media at 37 C to OD600=0.4, washing twice with 1 mL ice-cold water, resuspending in 40 µL water, electroporation of 1–10 ng plasmid with the EC1 setting of a Micropulser (BioRad), and recovering for 1 hour at 37 C in SOC media.

Plasmid pZH509 [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0187259] was used as a template to amplify the bicistronic regulatory construct including the P~LtetO-1~ promoter, GFPmut2 [@doi:10.1016/0378-1119(95)00685-0], tn10 TetR [@doi:10.1093/nar/12.12.4849] and rrnB T1 transcription terminator [@doi:10.1002/j.1460-2075.1996.tb00854.x]. This was assembled by isothermal assembly with the backbone from pGB2 [@doi:10.1016/0378-1119(84)90207-5] with the pSC101 origin of replication and spectinomycin resistance to generate plasmid pJS101. Plasmids with the pSC101 and p15a origins of replication have been co-transformed in previous synthetic biology experiments [@doi:10.1186/1754-1611-5-12].
