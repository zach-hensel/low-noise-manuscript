## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Some microbiology experiments and biotechnology applications can be improved if it is possible to tune the expression of two different genes at the same time with cell-to-cell variation at or below the level of genes constitutively expressed from the chromosome (the “extrinsic noise limit”). This was recently achieved for a single gene by exploiting negative autoregulation by the tetracycline repressor, and bicistronic gene expression to reduce gene expression noise. We report several new plasmids that use the same principles to achieve simultaneous, low-noise expression for two genes. This system was moved to a compatible plasmid backbone, and a system based on the lactose repressor was found to also exhibit gene expression noise below the extrinsic noise limit. We further investigated the effects of increasing repressor binding strength and the addition of a weak constitutive promoter on protein induction and expression noise.
