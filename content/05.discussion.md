## Discussion

We expect that the expression plasmids introduced here will be widely useful for applications in molecular biology. Adopting these systems for use with any 

Possible to improve pJS23103 with somewhat stronger promoter?

Possible to extend to 3 genes? Possible using additional repressor, pMB1 origin of replication, and different antibiotic selection.


Why this would it be useful to do this for two different genes at the same time?
Example for stoichiometric production of a protein complex
Expressing genes at their native levels â€¦ e.g. for generating chromosome deletions
