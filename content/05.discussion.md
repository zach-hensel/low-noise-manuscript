## Discussion

We expect that the expression plasmids introduced here will be useful for diverse applications in molecular biology. Expression and purification of heteromeric protein complexes could be improved by stoichiometric production of their components, mimicking proportional synthesis in natural systems [@pmid:30553725]. Additionally, low-noise expression can improve protein production yields [@pmid:27525986]. These systems could also be used in synthetic biology applications where yields can be improved by sequential induction of different components with low cell-to-cell variability. The capacity for low-noise expression at very low expression levels makes them particularly promising for single-molecule imaging experiments or for recombinant expression of low-copy-number components with low cell-to-cell variation to reproduce chromosomal expression levels.

Using modern molecular cloning techniques, it is simple to replace GFPmut2 in pJS101 and pJS102 with genes of interest. The apparent insensitivity of this circuit to regulatory parameters (DNA and inducer binding affinities) suggests that it can be easily extended to a third repressor-based expression system. Further, additional ribosome binding sites can be added to the bicistronic operon to express additional components.
