### Moving bicistronic autoregulatory construct to a compatible plasmid backbone

The first step in creating a low-noise system for tuning expression of two genes is to establish that a previously characterized bicistronic autoregulatory circuit functions well in a compatible plasmid backbone. In this expression system, GFP and TetR are expressed bicistronically from the TetR-repressible promoter P~LtetO-1~ and expression is induced by the addition of ATc [@pmid:29084263]. This system was shown to have low noise and a linearized dose response compared to a system in which TetR is constitutively expressed. We moved the system from a plasmid with a p15A replicon conferring ampicillin resistance to a lower-copy-number plasmid with a pSC101 replicon conferring spectinomycin resistance [@pmid:6098521]. The p15A and pSC101 replicons have been used together in multiplasmid systems [@pmid:21933410].

GFP expression mean and noise were characterized from low to high levels of induction by flow cytometry. **Figure {@fig:pZH509-pJS101}** shows that pJS101 induces at similar ATc concentrations as pZH509, with the change to the lower-copy pSC101 backbone resulting in a 58% drop in mean expression levels at a wide range of ATc concentrations. For a similar expression system in the absence of autoregulated TetR expression, moving the P~LtetO-1~ promoter from a p15A to a pSC101 backbone resulted in an 87% drop in expression [@pmid:9092630]. A smaller change is expected in our experiment since negative autoregulation will provide dosage compensation, just autoregulation can reduce noise in plasmid copy number [@pmid:16883354; @pmid:10850721; @pmid:14749823].

### Alternative regulatory constructs with LacI replacing TetR

We hypothesized that replacing P~LtetO-1~ with the inducible promoter P~LlacO-1~,  with similar characteristics [@pmid:9092630], and replacing TetR with LacI might result in a similarly useful expression system that could be tuned independently. However, regulatory parameters for TetR and LacI vary significantly. TetR binds *tetO2* more strongly than LacI binds *lacO1* (approximately 0.5—1.0 kcal/mol difference in binding energy [@pmid:14764926; @pmid:2182324] for a single site, with 2 tandem sites in our constructs). And, TetR binds ATc much more strongly than LacI binds IPTG [@pmid:10978179; @pmid:16432263].

We first characterized induction of GFP expression in MG1655 cells harboring IPTG-inducible pJS102 by flow cytometry. **Figure {@fig:pJS102-mean-noise}a** shows an induction range of almost 2 orders of magnitude from 0 to 1250 µM IPTG, with very good reproducibility of induction levels in 3 independent experiments. Previous experiments with the TetR-based system showed a large jump in expression going from 0 nM to 0.5 nM ATc [@pmid:29084263]. This effect is not seen for pJS102, suggesting that switching from TetR:ATc to LacI:IPTG improves the dynamic range of achievable induction levels to a small extent.

Next, we compared noise in protein expression, with the concern that the *lac* operon present in the MG1655 host strain could lead to all-or-none expression at intermediate IPTG concentrations [@pmid:16590055]. However, **Figure {@fig:pJS102-mean-noise}b** shows low noise in GFP expression at all IPTG concentrations, with noise levels comparable to pZH509 and pJS102 at the same mean GFP levels. Note that apparently high noise at very low expression is partially due to measurement noise (see Methods), and, at any rate, is much lower than noise when expression is regulated by a constitutively expressed repressor [@pmid:29084263]. Here, we also note that noise for pJS101, with its lower-copy-number pSC101 replicon, is lower than that for pZH509 or pJS102 at similar expression levels. This suggests that incorporating this construct into the chromosome, where copy number is more tightly regulated, may lead to a further noise reduction.

### Using the new induction system for detection of single mRNA in living *E. coli*

Recently, an improved method for detection of mRNA by local enrichment of fluorescent, RNA-binding proteins was reported in *S. cerevisiae* [@pmid:29131164]. This reduced the aggregation of mRNAs bound by the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein, which has also caused mRNA immortalization that has limited experiments in *E. coli* to observing transcription just after induction [@pmid:16360033]. We hypothesized that aggregation could be reduced by reducing the expression levels of both mRNA and mRNA-binding proteins, and by having low cell-to-cell variation in expression. We developed a strain in which mRNA molecules encoding mVenus-Cro and also including 24 tandem repeats of the binding sequence for the PP7 coat protein (PP7cp) [@pmid:21512033] were constitutively expressed at low levels (less than 1 molecule per cell). Plasmid pJS102 was used as a template to develop a fluorescent, IPTG-inducible reporter of expression, PP7cp-SYFP2.

We tested the utility of this expression system for tuning low-noise gene expression in different growth conditions. In previous experiments, we expressed the RNA-binding protein from a constitutive promoter integrated into the chromosome; this required long cycles of optimization every time a parameter was changed (growth media, temperature, fluorescent protein sequence) that changed protein expression levels. **Figure {@fig:pZH713-optimization}a**  shows that single-molecule mRNA detection was optimal at 100 µM IPTG in partially rich media. We note the absence of pole-localized fluorescent spots that characterize mRNA aggregation [@pmid:20562858], and that we observed reasonable mRNA lifetimes of a few minutes in timelapse imaging. We moved to minimal media hoping to find a growth condition with lower mRNA expression levels, but found that 100 µM IPTG gave a background of unbound PP7cp-SYFP2 molecules that often made it impossible to detect mRNA spots. **Figure {@fig:pZH713-optimization}b** shows how the IPTG-inducible expression system made it simple to quickly scan several different PP7cp-SYFP induction conditions and identify 10—20 µM IPTG as an optimal growth condition.

Lastly, we note that the strain used for mRNA imaging has its entire *lac* operon replaced by the synthetic construct. Thus, this expression system works well both in the presence and absence of the *lac* operon.

### Independent, tunable expression of two genes

Lastly, we tested whether ATc-inducible and IPTG-inducible plasmids could be combined to achieve low-noise expression of two genes into the same cell. We replaced GFPmut2 in pJS102 with the fast-maturing RFP mScarlet-I [@pmid:28931898] to create the plasmid pDG101. This plasmid was co-transformed with pJS101 into *E. coli* MG1655 and green and red fluorescence were compared at different combinations of ATc and IPTG concentrations. **Figure {@fig:pJS101-pDG101}a** shows that pJS101 induction by ATc was unaffected by pDG101 induction by IPTG, and that all conditions gave low noise in GFP concentration. **Figure {@fig:pJS101-pDG101}b** shows that mScarlet-I expression from pDG101 was similarly unaffected by the level of pJS101 induction by ATc. Thus, independent, tunable expression of two genes can be achieved by replacing GFPmut2 in pJS101 and pJS102 with other genes of interest and co-transforming the plasmids into *E. coli*.
